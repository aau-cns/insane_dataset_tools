# Description

The INSANE data set is a multi-sensor cross-domain UAV data set (18 sensors) with accurate and absolute 6 DoF ground truth. The scenarios include indoor flights in a controlled environment with motion capture ground truth, outdoor-to-indoor transition flights with continuous ground truth, and extensive coverage of Mars analog data with the same vehicle. Mars analog data includes segments with various ground structures, cliff flight over, and cliff-wall traversing trajectories for mapping.

This data set is ideal for testing novel algorithms with real-world sensor data and corresponding effects such as sensor degradation. Dedicated raw data for customized sensor calibration routines and vibration data for vehicle integrity tests are provided.
